# AgriKoła

Experimental, small project, as aggregation of surnames in a form of grid, clasified by surname specific. 

# Naming
Just a words play... but:

- [agricola](https://glosbe.com/la/en/agricola) - latin word, which means "farmer" or "peasant" or "agrarian". In genealogical communities, especially beginners do not know this meaning (when they translate Latin-Polish texts to Ukraininan), so I wanted to spread it out.
- Main purpose of project is to aggregate data from other services and files.
- [Koła](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko%C5%82a) is a noble surname in 1470-1480 years in East Galicia (Ukraine), whom I'm trying to research more, because someone from them might be related to history of village where I born. _Koła_ is a polish version, and latin form of surname is _Cola_.

# Description
Based on list of "root" part of possible surnames, JavaScript code concantenate with "ending" with possible surnames, and combine in one word. Then hyperlink created refering to well known service [Ridni.Org](https://ridni.org/karta/).

# TODO
- Tooltip with prject description.
- Integrate with ridni.org via API calls for map preview. Maybe via `iframe`???
