# AgriKoła

Experimental, small project, as aggregation of surnames in a form of grid, clasified by surname specific. 

# Naming

- Latin word [agricola](https://glosbe.com/la/en/agricola) means farmer or peasant or agrarian. In genealogical communities, especially newbies do not know this meaning, so I wanted to spread it out.
- Main purpose of project is to aggregate data from other services and files.
- [Koła](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko%C5%82a) is a noble surname in 1470-1480 years in East Galicia (Ukraine), whom I'm trying to research more, because someone from them might be related to history of village where I born. _Koła_ is a polish version, and latin form of surname is _Cola_.
